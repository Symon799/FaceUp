The project currently contains the following functions:

- Grayscale Conversion (convertToGreylevel)
- Integral Image (convertToMatrix)
- Calculation of haar features (haar)

Type make to compile the code.
./main image.png can be used to launch our program with an 24x24 (or bigger) picture.
First, the original image will be shown, then you can press Enter to convert it to grayscale and finally, press Enter again to get the output which represents the grayscale and the integral image values of the picture.
The last two lines are testing if our function works.
